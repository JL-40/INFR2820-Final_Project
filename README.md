# INFR2820-Final_Project

## Setup
Ensure that the 'GraphData.txt' is in with the .cpp code.

### GraphData.txt
The file is a CSV file where each line adds a new neighbor to a vertex. All Charging Stations are represented as lower case. The format is as this: "Vertex, Neighbor, Weight".

## Execution
When the program is executed, it will load and display the list of neighbors to the player (All nodes are uppercased). After which the program will ask for the user for a starting point to find the closest route to a Charging
Station. This is case sensitive, so any Charging Stations will be in lower case.
